# Glot

### The locale manager for rails
#### and all other things in config/locale

Tired of looking for keys nested deep inside your language files? Tired of looking for the right places and finding the right alphabetically ordered spot in your locale files to insert your new entry? Tired of manually looking through your language files to diff them? Tire no longer, glot is here!

With glot you can sort your language files:

```
$ glot sort
```

You can easily add a key to all your language files too, just go

```
$ glot add activerecord.fireworks.explode
["en"]
"activerecord.fireworks.explode"
["ja"]
"activerecord.fireworks.explode"
```

and you will see an addition to all your language files:

```yml
en:
  activerecord:
    fireworks:
      explode: TRANSLATE_ME
```

Can't find something in your 10000000 lines of translations?

```
glot find explode
{:path=>"en.explode", :v=>"bewm"}
{:path=>"en.activerecord.fireworks.explode", :v=>"Explode beautifully"}
```

Afraid you forgot to translate something?

```
$ glot translate_mes
en.activerecord.fireworks.explode
```

Want to see the difference between language files?

```
$ glot diff

en
-----------------------
ja
=======================

ja
-----------------------
activerecord.fireworks.put_out
=======================
```

Oops! Japanese is missing a `put_out` translation! Time to add it in:

```
$ glot add activerecord.fireworks.put_out
```

It will not overwrite existing translations.

You can also diff language files individually:

```
$ glot diff ja

ja
-----------------------
activerecord.fireworks.put_out
=======================
```


## Installation

Find paths that still have TRANSLATE_ME in them

    glot translate_mes

    glot diff [lang]
